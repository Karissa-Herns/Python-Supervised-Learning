# Python-Supervised-Learning
In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. 
I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data. 
My goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article 
"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". 
The data investigated here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
